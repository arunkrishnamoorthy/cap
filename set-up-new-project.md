# Setting up a new Project in VS Code

To start a new CAP Project for development, open the visual studio code and open a workspace/folder location where you want to build your service. 

Execute the following command to initialize a new project. 

```
cds init <name_of_project>
```

Example:

``` 
cds init my-bookshop 
``` 

This command creates a directory called my-bookshop in the current directory where your VS Code terminal is at.
