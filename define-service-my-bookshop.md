# Define the Service - My Bookshop Project 

To add contents to the app, define a service by adding a simple [Domain Model](domain-model.md).

As a pre-requisites, i would recommend you read the following concepts to understand better the service that we are going to build. 
It is important to understand the following terms
- [What is an Aspect?](aspect.md)
- [What are Entity and Types](entity-and-types.md) 
- [Why we use @sap/cds/common cds](common-cds-sdk.md)

In the srv folder, create a new file with an extension .cds
