# Common CDS from SDK

Common CDS is a reusable model that is pre-built and shipped as part of CAP CDS. 

```
@sap/cds/common
```

The advantages of using reusable models is to reduce the implementation efforts, streamline the project development. Optimize implementation and runtime performance. Automated support for localization and value helps. Additional properties required can be extended using [Aspects](aspect.md).
