# Add Initial Data - My Bookshop Project 

Earlier in the tutorial, we added the data for the service, in the Service.js file implementing service.on('read'....). 
In this section, we will see how to load the initial data from the CSV file. 

I am going to populate the entity "Authors" with data from CSV files. Hence i am commenting the code earlier written in the Service.js file. 

Next, create a CSV file in the db folder and add the data to the file. 

> Sometimes for the changes to reflect we need to stop the server and restart it with command ```cds watch```.
