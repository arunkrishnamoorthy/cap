# Install Node JS

Node JS is a Javascript based runtime which the CAP Application is based on and requires Node JS installation for the installation of tools and packages.

To confirm if the Node JS is already installed in the device, run the following command in the terminal / bash.

```
node -v
```

This should return you the output of the Node JS version, if it is already installed.

If you don't have Node JS runtime, go to the offical [Node JS - Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) Site.
Download as per your operating system. Use the LTS ( Long term support ) version of the Node JS for Stability.
Make sure you install the correct bit version as per your operating system.
